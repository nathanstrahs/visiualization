# OSCAL Zero Trust Visualization App

## üåü Overview

This is a web application tool used to visualize the state and baseline of security of a model or cluster. It includes easy-to-understand visualization graphs and charts to assess the current passing/failing components from the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 zero-trust framework. The application extracts information from a assessment-results.json file written in OSCAL. Examples of such a file can be found [here](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/tree/main/examples/ar/json).

More about OSCAL can be found [here](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/tree/main). More about NIST can be found [here](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/).

## üìä Understanding the Visualization

More extensive information can be found at [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final)
### Summary:
* NIST components are mapped to 7 Department of Defense (DoD) pillars of security:
    * User
    * Device
    * Network and Enviornment
    * Application and Workload
    * Data
    * Visibility and Analytics
    * Automation and Orchestration
* If the component is unable to be mapped to any DoD pillar, it is placed in the 'other' catagory
* NIST components are also mapped to 4 different security baselines:
    * High
    * Moderate
    * Low
    * None

### Legend for components:
* ac - Access Control
* at - Awareness and Training
* au - Audit and Accountability
* ca - Assessment, Authorization and Monitoring
* cm - Configuration Management
* cp - Contingency Planning
* ia - Identification and Authentication
* ir - Incident Response
* ma - Maintenance
* mp - Media Protection
* pe - Physical and Environmental Protection
* pl - Planning
* pm - Program Management
* ps - Personnel Security
* pt - Personally Identifiable Information Processing and Transparency
* ra - Risk Assessment
* sa - System and Services Acquisition
* sc - System and Communications Protection
* si - System and Information Integrity
